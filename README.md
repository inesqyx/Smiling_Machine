# Smiling_Machine
This repo contains the ML model for the Smling Machine developed by Frank Lu, Ruoheng Wang and Ines Qian. 

File component and expalnation:
* APS360 Progress Report Gantt Chart: A Gantt Chart to track the team's progress on the project. The screenshot of which is used as an evidence in the team's project progress report.
* SMILES.zip: Smiles dataset 
* Smiling_Machine_Baseline_Autoencoder: An autoencoder network, served as the baseline model for the project (developed by Cathy & Frank). The model is freezed at the time of the project progress report. 
* Smiling_Machine_Primary_GAN: A GAN network, served as the primary model for the project (developed by Ines). The model is freezed at the time of the project progress report 
* Smiling_Mahcine_Primary_GAN(2);(3): A continuous development on the Smiling_Machine_Primary_GAN (updated by Ines). The model is freezed at the time of the presentation; final report 
* Smiling_Machine_Primary_cGAN ;(2): A conditional GAN modified from the Smiling_Machine_Primary_GAN (modified by Ines). The model is freezed at the time of the presentation; final report
